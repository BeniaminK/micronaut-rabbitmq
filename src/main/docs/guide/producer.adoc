The example in the quick start presented a trivial definition of an interface that be implemented automatically for you using the ann:configuration.rabbitmq.annotation.RabbitClient[] annotation.

The implementation that powers `@RabbitClient` (defined by the api:configuration.rabbitmq.intercept.RabbitMQIntroductionAdvice[] class) is, however, very flexible and offers a range of options for defining RabbitMQ producers.

== Exchange

The exchange to publish messages to can be provided through the ann:configuration.rabbitmq.annotation.RabbitClient[] annotation.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@RabbitClient("amq.topic")
static interface ProductClient {
    ...
}
----
