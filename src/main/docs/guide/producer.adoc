The example in the quick start presented a trivial definition of an interface that be implemented automatically for you using the ann:configuration.rabbitmq.annotation.RabbitClient[] annotation.

== Exchange

The exchange to publish messages to can be provided through the ann:configuration.rabbitmq.annotation.RabbitClient[] annotation. In this example, the client is publishing messages to a custom header exchange called `animals`.
