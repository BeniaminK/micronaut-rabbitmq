The purpose of this library is to consume and publish messages with RabbitMQ. Any setup of queues, exchanges, or the binding between them is *not* done automatically. If your requirements dictate that your application should be creating those entities, then a link:{apimicronaut}context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener] can be registered to intercept the api:configuration.rabbitmq.connect.ChannelPool[] to perform operations with the Java API directly.

For all of the examples in this documentation, an event listener has been registered to create the required queues, exchanges, and bindings necessary for the code to be tested.

snippet::io.micronaut.configuration.rabbitmq.ChannelPoolListener[tags="imports,clazz", project-base="docs-examples/example]

<1> The class is declared as a singleton so it will be registered with the context
<2> The generic specifies what bean type we want to intercept
<3> Retrieve the bean from the event
<4> Retrieve a channel from the pool
<5> Declare a queue or perform any operations desired
<6> Ensure that under all conditions the channel is returned to the pool
<7> Return the pool object to be injected where it is needed
