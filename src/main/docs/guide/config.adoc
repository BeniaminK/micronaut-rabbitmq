All properties on the link:{apirabbit}client/ConnectionFactory.html[ConnectionFactory] are available to be modified, either through configuration or a link:{apimicronaut}context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener].

The properties that can be converted from the string values in a configuration file can be configured directly. For example:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
rabbitmq:
    uri:
//or
rabbitmq:
    host:
    port:
    username:
    password:
    virtual-host:
----

NOTE: Without any configuration the defaults in the `ConnectionFactory` will be used.

To configure things like the link:{apirabbit}client/SaslConfig.html[SaslConfig] a bean created event listener can be registered to intercept the creation of the connection factory.

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class ConnectionFactoryInterceptor implements BeanCreatedEventListener<ConnectionFactory> {

    @Override
    public ConnectionFactory onCreated(BeanCreatedEvent<ConnectionFactory> event) {
        ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = event.getBean();
        connectionFactory.setSaslConfig(...);
        return connectionFactory;
    }
}
