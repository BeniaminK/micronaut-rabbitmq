All properties on the link:{apirabbit}client/ConnectionFactory.html[ConnectionFactory] are available to be modified, either through configuration or a link:{apimicronaut}context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener].

The properties that can be converted from the string values in a configuration file can be configured directly.

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.configuration.rabbitmq.connect.RabbitConnectionFactoryConfig.adoc[]


NOTE: Without any configuration the defaults in the link:{apirabbit}client/ConnectionFactory.html[ConnectionFactory] will be used.

To configure things like the link:{apirabbit}client/impl/CredentialsProvider.html[CredentialsProvider] a bean created event listener can be registered to intercept the creation of the connection factory.
