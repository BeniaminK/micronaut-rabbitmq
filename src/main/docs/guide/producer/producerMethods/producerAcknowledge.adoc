Client methods support 2 return types, void and a reactive type. If the method returns void, the message will be published and the method will return immediately without acknowledgement. If a reactive type is the return type, a "cold" publisher will be returned that can be subscribed to.

Since the publisher is cold, the message will not actually be published until the stream is subscribed to.

Micronaut comes with RxJava2 by default, and the link:http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Completable.html[Completable] type is the reactive type that best fits the publisher acknowledgement use case. No value of any type is returned, the message is either acknowledged or not.
