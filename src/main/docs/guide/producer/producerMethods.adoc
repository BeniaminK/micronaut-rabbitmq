All methods that publish messages to RabbitMQ must meet the following conditions:

* The method must reside in a class annotated with ann:configuration.rabbitmq.annotation.RabbitClient[].
* The method must contain an argument representing the body of the message.

IMPORTANT: If a body argument cannot be found, an exception will be thrown.
