A ann:configuration.rabbitmq.annotation.Queue[] annotation is required for a method to be a consumer of messages from RabbitMQ. Simply apply the annotation to the method and supply the name of the queue you would like to listen to.

IMPORTANT: Queues must already exist before you can listen to messages from them.

<1> The queue annotation is set per method. Multiple methods may be defined with different queues in the same class.

TIP: The ann:configuration.rabbitmq.annotation.Queue[] annotation supports additional options for consuming messages including declaring the consumer as exclusive, whether to re-queue rejected messages, or set an unacknowledged message limit.
